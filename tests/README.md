# ubox MSX lib test suite

The tests are written in python 3 and follow this convention:

| Test class | Filename |
| --- | --- |
| TestMyCase | test_my_case.py |

See `test_rom.py` as an example.

Remember to make the test file executable!

**TODO**: add a module to support openMSX remote control.
